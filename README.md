# Task 1: software design and development (part B) Program design 

Main Steps: Pseudocode 

1. Store the endings
2. Enter the number of students
3. Start fixed loop for each student 
4. Enter first three letters of student’s name
5. Generate random number
6. Generate username
7. Display the username 
8. End Loop 

REFINEMENTS 

**4.1** Start conditional loop\
**4.2** Get the first three letters of student’s name\
**4.3** If the length of the name is not equal to 3 then\
**4.4** Display an error message End If\
**4.5** Repeat until the name entered is 3 characters long

**6.1** If the first random number was generated add the first stored ending to the end of the first three letters of the student’s name\
**6.2** If the second random number was generated add the second stored ending to the end of the first three letters of the student’s name\
**6.3** If the third random number was generated add the third stored ending to the end of the first three letters of the student’s name\
**6.4** If the fourth random number was generated add the fourth stored ending to the end of the first three letters of the student’s name\
**6.5** If the fifth random number was generated add the fifth stored ending to the end of the first three letters of the student’s name

**1b** Using the program design and refinements, implement the program in a language of your choice. Ensure the program matches the pseudocode provided.
